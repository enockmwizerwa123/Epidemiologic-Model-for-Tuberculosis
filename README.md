# Epidemiologic-Model-for-Tuberculosis

A deterministic system in mathematics, computer science, and physics is one in which no randomness is involved in the development of the system's future states. 
As a result, a deterministic model will always produce the same output from the same starting condition or initial state.
A stochastic model is a tool that allows for random variation in one or more inputs over time to estimate probability distributions of potential outcomes. 
Typically, random variation is based on fluctuations observed in historical data for a given period using standard time-series techniques.
In this project we have developed a deterministic model for Tuberculosis in Africa
